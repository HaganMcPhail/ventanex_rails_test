# Setup
- You will probably need to change the application.yml file to your local database credentials
```
bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed_fu
may have to run `mysql.server start` in the command line
rails s
```

# Test
1. Commit code to your repository at start
2. Make the create button work and shows a form that allows a user to enter nickname, account number, and account type
3. Implement Account Class to read xml file(assets/xml/loan.xml) and find the loan number and borrower name in the xml to be displayed in pay_accounts/index.html.erb(can be placed anyhwhere in the index file)
4. Use javascript/jQuery to connect the hide button. The button should replace the all the characters except the last 4, with *.
Example: 4111111111111111 -> ************1111

# Extra Credit(but not required)
1. Create a new migration for a user
2. Write some tests for pay_accounts
3. Build a navigation bar
4. Feel free to add anything you might feel adds to the project
